# Coding Style

- Make code easier for other programmer to read and understand. Very important because often this code is worked on by multiple people during lifetime. Clean code help avoid errors and make it go smoother. Some type of coding style:
    - How and when to use comments
    - Tabs or spaces for indentation (and how many spaces),
    - Appropriate use of white space,
    - Proper naming of variables and functions,
    - Code grouping an organization,
    - Patterns to be used,
    - Patterns to be avoided.
